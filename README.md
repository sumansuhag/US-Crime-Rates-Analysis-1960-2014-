# US-Crime-Rates-Analysis-1960-2014-
Problem Statement: Perform exploratory data analysis on a chosen dataset.

📊 US Crime Rates Analysis (1960-2014)
Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of crime rates in the United States from 1960 to 2014. The dataset includes various crime categories, allowing for an in-depth exploration of trends, patterns, and anomalies over more than five decades. The analysis utilizes Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.
